      <p>
        Indonesia is the largest archipelago in the world. It consists of five
        major islands and about 30 smaller groups. The islands are located at a
        crossroads between two oceans, the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and
        straddles two continents, Asia and Australia/Oceania. Its strategic
        location in maritime Southeast Asia has always shaped the cultural,
        social, political and economic life of the country, which only gained
        independence from the Netherlands in 1949.
