The islands are located at a crossroads between two oceans, the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and straddles two continents, Asia and Australia/Oceania. Its strategic location in maritime Southeast Asia has always shaped the cultural, social, political and economic life of the country, which only gained independence from the Netherlands in 1949."
